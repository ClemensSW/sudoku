## Early Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal

The right of withdrawal expires prematurely if:

1. **You have expressly consented** to me beginning the performance of the contract before the end of the withdrawal period, **AND**
2. **You have acknowledged** that you will lose your right of withdrawal by giving your consent to the beginning of the performance of the contract.

### When Does the Right of Withdrawal Expire?
