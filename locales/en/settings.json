I'm Clemens â€“ and Sudoku Duo is my first self-developed app.\n\nI love brain teasers and wanted to create a Sudoku app that not only relaxes and challenges, but also connects: With the unique 2-player mode, Sudoku becomes a shared experience â€“ perfect for friends, couples or friendly competitions.\n\nIf you like the app, I would really appreciate your support. Your rating in the Play Store helps me to further develop Sudoku Duo and new projects.\n\nThank you for being part of it.\nHappy Puzzling! ðŸ§©"
