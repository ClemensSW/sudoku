# Right of Withdrawal

## Right of Withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period is fourteen days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform me:

**Clemens Walther - AppVentures**
Malzstraße 12
42119 Wuppertal
Email: info@playfusion-gate.de

by means of a clear statement (e.g., a letter sent by post or email) of your decision to withdraw from this contract.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

## Consequences of Withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, I shall reimburse to you all payments received from you without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which I am informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract.

For this repayment, the Google Play refund system will be used. The refund will be processed through your Google Play account.

## Special Notes for Digital Content

### Early Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal

Your right of withdrawal expires prematurely if:

1. You have expressly consented to me beginning the performance of the contract before the end of the withdrawal period, **AND**
2. You have acknowledged that you will lose your right of withdrawal by giving your consent to the beginning of the performance of the contract.

### In-App Purchases via Google Play

For in-app purchases through the Google Play Store, you give this consent **automatically:**
- By confirming the purchase, you consent to the immediate provision of the digital content
- You acknowledge that your right of withdrawal thereby expires
- The digital content (2× EP bonus, image unlocks) is provided immediately after purchase confirmation

**Practical Consequence:**
After completing an in-app purchase and immediate provision of the digital content, the right of withdrawal expires. This complies with the legal provisions for digital content (§ 356 para. 5 BGB).

### Exceptions and Goodwill

In special cases (e.g., technical problems, faulty provision), you can still contact Google Play or me directly:

**Google Play Refund:**
- Google Play has its own refund policies
- Requests via: Google Play Store → Account → Order History
