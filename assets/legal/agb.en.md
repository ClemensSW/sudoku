## 12. Final Provisions

### 12.1 Applicable Law

The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

For consumers, this choice of law only applies insofar as it does not restrict mandatory legal provisions of the country in which you have your habitual residence.

### 12.2 Place of Jurisdiction

The statutory place of jurisdiction applies to consumers.

If you are a merchant, legal person under public law, or special fund under public law, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract is my place of business (Wuppertal, Germany).

### 12.3 Severability Clause

Should individual provisions of these terms be invalid or unenforceable, or become invalid or unenforceable after conclusion of the contract, the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected.

In place of the invalid or unenforceable provision, the valid and enforceable provision whose effects come closest to the economic objective pursued by the parties with the invalid or unenforceable provision shall apply.

### 12.4 Dispute Resolution

I am neither obligated nor willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board (cf. § 36 VSBG).
